The background color of the app should be randomized as well.
colors = ['#FFBF00', '#0080FF', '#01DF3A', '#FF0080']

## Level 2: personalized compliment

When you visit `"/name"` (ie: `"/randy"`), the greeting should personalize itself to the provided name. There should still be a random compliment and background color.

## Level 3: user submitted compliments

Allow a user to add to the list of compliments using a POST request. You can submit POST requests to the app using Postman or a form.

How/where would you store these compliments?
